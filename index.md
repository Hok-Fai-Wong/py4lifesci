This is the Python code repository for all of the code examples in the book: [_Python for the Life Sciences_](http://pythonforthelifesciences.com) released by @amberbiology. 

From here you can directly browse the code from the book, or download it to try it out, or even use and/or adapt it for your your own research.

[_Python for the Life Sciences_](http://pythonforthelifesciences.com) is a gentle introduction to the Python programming language that was written to help life scientists with no prior experience in coding, to introduce computation into their research. This is a hit-the-ground-running course in Python that is taught using real biological applications including next-generation sequencing and genomics, biochemical kinetics, scientific data parsing and analysis, population dynamics, molecular modeling, and biochemical network analysis, to name but a few.
